# CMSE831 Final Project

University: Michigan State University <br>
Professor: Dr. Longxiu Huang <br>
Course: CMSE831 Computational Optimization

* All material is a collaboration between me, Nickolaus White, and my fellow researchers Aditya Jain, Mark Carravallah, Stephen Lee, Hunter Pierson.
* This project explores the development of a facial recognition system aimed at accurately predicting the identity associated with a given face. Utilizing images collected through a webcam, we employed a diverse set of machine learning models, including Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal was to assess the performance of these models in accurately associating facial features with corresponding identities and then optimizing those models with techniques learned in class to improve accuracy and/or efficiency.
* Further research surrounding this project can be found in my report linked within this GitHub repository.
